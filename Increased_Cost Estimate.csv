My Notes,,,,,,
"I modified the EC2 Instance type and the RDS Instance type, and chose instance types with more compute/memory resources.",,,,,,
I increased the number of EC2 instances for scalability from 16 to 24 instances,,,,,,
I added a third Availability Zone for enhance the redundancy/availability of compute & DB resources,,,,,,
